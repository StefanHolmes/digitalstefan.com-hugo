# Moving to a proper static site generator

I'd heard about [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) near the end of 2023, but I got so busy with work that I had no energy left to spend enough time to learn how to use it.

hugo lets me mostly write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and not have to worry about HTML or CSS. I especially don't have to work hard to include common content or behind-the-scenes scripts on every page. I've been using Netlify's own post-processing to add things like the Google Tag Manager script and CookieBot, but that's not a "nice" way to do things.

I'm still using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free hosting, because they mesh nicely with hugo and Github.
